A web app to review, rate, and search for local restaurant and dining hall food. Was built to encourage people to try new foods with confidence. Works on any device, built with mobile-first design process. 

## Tech Stack Used

Used React.js for front end and Firebase for backend database, file storage, and authentication tasks. Used tailwindcss + daisyui plugin to design the UI/UX for the app. Implemented Algolia Search to create a search engine to search for restaurants/menu items.

## Future Impovements

Currently working on a recommendation system that considers your previous reviews and interacted posts to recommend new food that a user may enjoy. 

Implementing the Google Places API to allow user to search for the exact location and embed links to the location and restaurant websites.
